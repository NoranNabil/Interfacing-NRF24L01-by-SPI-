Here is a library for interfacing the NRF24L01 module via SPI. You can use it with any MCU that supports SPI using your MCAL layer libraries.
You should make sure that the channel number and data rate are the same in the transmitter and the receiver in your application layer.
There is an Arduino Uno code example to use it as a transmitter.
